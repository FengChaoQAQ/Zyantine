## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, we ask that you report them privately to our dedicated security email address. This allows us to address the issue before it becomes publicly known.

**Please email your findings to `1761938351@qq.com`.**

We kindly ask you to provide as much information as possible in your report, including:

*   **A clear description** of the vulnerability.
*   The **version(s)** of the software affected.
*   **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability. This is crucial for us to verify and fix the issue quickly. Please include any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or videos.
*   The **potential impact** of the vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, data leakage).
*   Any **known mitigations** or workarounds, if you have identified any.

## Our Commitment

Once you have submitted a report, you can expect the following process:

1.  **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
2.  **Triage & Investigation**: We will investigate the report to confirm the vulnerability. We may contact you for more information during this phase. We aim to complete this within **7 business days**.
3.  **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a patch. The timeline for a fix will vary depending on the complexity of the issue. We will keep you informed of our progress.
4.  **Disclosure**: Once the patch is ready, we will coordinate a release date with you. We will issue a security advisory (e.g., via GitHub Security Advisories) and credit you for your discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous. We typically aim to disclose vulnerabilities publicly **90 days** after the initial report, or sooner if a patch is available.

We appreciate your partnership in keeping [Your Project Name] and its users safe.
